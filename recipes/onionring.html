        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Oil for frying</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>3/4 cup of flour</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon celery salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon parsley flakes</li>
            <li>3 dashes of hot sauce</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 large onions, sliced</li>
            <h5>Instructions</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Add enough oil to a Dutch oven so that it comes halfway up the sides of the pot. Heat over 
                    medium heat until it reaches a temperature of 190Â°C.
                </li>
                <li>Meanwhile, combine buttermilk, flour, egg, baking powder, paprika, celery salt, parsley, hot sauce, 
                    salt and pepper in a large bowl. Whisk until ingredients are combined and batter is very smooth.
                </li>
                <li>Separate onion slices into rings and dip each one in batter. Shake excess batter off rings and lower 
                    them carefully into the hot oil, in batches if necessary. Cook until deep golden brown, about 1 minute 
                    per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain and repeat remaining rings. Serve immediately.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
